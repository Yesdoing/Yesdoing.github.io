## Donald Trump 영작

Donald Trump who had been CEO of The Trump Organization is president on the U.S.A. I think He is troublemaker in USA Because, Since he became president, He often make trouble which he created a conflict of ally by his behavior or He declared lately Jerusalem is capital of Israel and so on.  When he was campaigning for a presidential election, He said ‘MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!’ but It is hard to believe him by his action. I think he is bad president even though His ability of managing company is good well.
