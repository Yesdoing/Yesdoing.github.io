## Donald Trump 영작

Donald Trump who had been CEO of The Trump Organization is president on the U.S.A. I think He is troublemaker in USA Because, Since he became president, He often make trouble which he created a conflict of ally by his behavior or He declared lately Jerusalem is capital of Israel and so on.  When he was campaigning for a presidential election, He said ‘MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!’ but It is hard to believe him by his action. I think he is bad president even though His ability of managing company is good well.

## Korea drinking culture 영작
Actually, I usually haven't plan which aim to drink alcohol. when I meet my friends I think We have two culture in drinking party.
First thing is We don't see bottom of glass because Looking bottom of glass mean he has not drink. It's not manner among us. So It is hard to drink with my friends.
Second one is if one of friends is birthday in the place which is drinking alcohol, We make cacktail mix every food of table for him. And my friend at the birthday has to drink cacktail   even if this cacktail has terrible flavor. Thereafter My friend usually has black-out.
