#### 영작
* 11. 15
I met my friends to eat pork in a restaurant where It is 힘내라고.
My friend was cooking meat on a grill Because my thumb got a slight injury.
The meat was very delicious as long as I didnt all the cooking.
And I thought that Finally my friend might do all those things even if I was not hurt on my thumb.


* 11. 16
I went to beauty parlor located 30min away from my house to get my hair cut after the work by this morning.
This beauty parlor was sizable because previous beauty parlor was Very disappointing by quality of service.
They treat me kindly and good.
So I made a reservation to have a perm next week.


##### Why do you want to learn Speaking English?
I like American culture such as drama. Popsong and so on. Because, I felt to differ Korea culture and Foreign culture. I think that foreign people take their own way to live their life.
I want to work in Silicon Valley. It is great place to work for programmer Because, Many Korean company work the same thing again and again unless staff can be growth. So, I wanna work in company at Silicon Valley. Therefore, I wanna study English and programming hard.
